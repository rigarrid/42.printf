42's printf Project

This is the README for the "printf" project from 42, an implementation of the "printf" function in the C programming language. The project aims to recreate the standard C "printf" function to print formatted data to the console.
Project Description

The 42's printf project aims to understand and recreate the basic functionality of the standard C "printf" function. The "printf" function allows printing data to the console in a specific format, using format specifiers to represent different types of data.

In this project, a simplified version of the "printf" function is implemented, which supports a variety of basic format specifiers, such as "%d" for integers, "%s" for strings, and "%c" for individual characters, among others. The goal is to understand how variable arguments and format string processing work in C.
Project Structure

Usage

To use the "printf" implementation, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

    Make sure the Libft library is present and compiled.

    Include the "ft_printf.h" header file in your C program.

    Use the "ft_printf" function as you would use the standard "printf" function. Pass the format string and any necessary arguments.

    Compile your program, linking it with the "printf" implementation.

    Run your program, and the formatted output will be printed to the console.

Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome. If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

The "printf" project was completed as part of the curriculum at 42, a coding school and community. Special thanks to the staff and mentors at 42 for their guidance and support.
